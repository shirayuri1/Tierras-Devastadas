				"The Bonded Eldritch Knight combines the martial mastery common to all fighters with the careful study of magic. They use magical techniques similar to those practiced by wizards, focusing their study on two of the eight schools of magic - abjuration and evocation. Abjuration spells grant an Eldritch Knight additional protection in combat, while evocation spells damage many enemies at once, extending the fighter's reach in combat. These knights learn a comparatively small number of spells, committting them to memory rather than keeping them in a spellbook.",
